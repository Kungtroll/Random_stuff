This applies for Windows Powershell...
 
I recently noticed that I was still running outdated PowershellGet and PackageManagement versions on my workstations. Those are missing some features that I needed, so I decided to update these modules. 
 
I first tried to do it with update-module PowershellGet
That didn't work since the module was shipped with powershell and not installed from powershell gallery. Hence I had to to this in another way. 
 
You can check your version with
 
PS P:\> get-Module -Name PowerShellGet -ListAvailable
 

    Directory: C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
 
ModuleType Version    Name                                ExportedCommands                                                                                                          
---------- -------    ----                                ----------------                                                                                                          
Script     1.0.0.1    PowerShellGet                       {​​​​​​​Install-Module, Find-Module, Save-Module, Update-Module...}​​​​​​​            
 
PS P:\> get-Module -Name PackageManagement -ListAvailable
 

    Directory: C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
 

ModuleType Version    Name                                ExportedCommands                                                                                                           
---------- -------    ----                                ----------------                                                                                                           
Binary     1.0.0.1    PackageManagement                   {​​​​​​​Find-Package, Get-Package, Get-PackageProvider, Get-PackageSource...}​​​​​​​           
 
 
In my case both modules are running on the initial version.

Create a Local folder where to download the Modules (you can choose a path and folder name of your own choosing):
PS C:\> mkdir PSRepo
 
Save the module from Powershell Gallery (in powershell)
PS C:\>  Save-Module -Name PowershellGet -Path C:\PSrepo
 
Install the module:
PS C:\>  Install-Module -Name PowershellGet -Force
 
Check what modules you have now:
PS C:\>  Get-Module -Name PowerShellGet -ListAvailable
PS C:\>  Get-Module -Name PackageManagement -ListAvailable
 
You should now see both the outdated versions and the new versions of PowerShellGet and PackageManagement.
 
Close Powershell, open explorer and navigate to Directory: C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
Go Into the module directories PowerShellGet and PackageManagement, remove the directories containing the old versions, or move them to another location where powershell won't find them.
 
Open Powershell again and verify that you are only using the updated modules.
PS C:\>  Get-Module -Name PowerShellGet -ListAvailable
PS C:\>  Get-Module -Name PackageManagement -ListAvailable

First create a Local repository, see this guide: Installing Powershell Modules "Offline" in Wiki and copy both the PowerShellGet and PackageManagement modules into your repository directory. I recommend using the last stable version (beta versions can have bugs).
 
Install the module:
PS C:\>  Install-Module -Name PowershellGet -Force
 
Check what modules you have now:
PS C:\>  Get-Module -Name PowerShellGet -ListAvailable
PS C:\>  Get-Module -Name PackageManagement -ListAvailable
 
You should now see both the outdated versions and the new versions of PowerShellGet and PackageManagement.
 
Close Powershell, open explorer and navigate to Directory: C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
Go Into the module directories PowerShellGet and PackageManagement, remove the directories containing the old versions, or move them to another location where powershell won't find them.
 
Open Powershell again and verify that you are only using the updated modules.
PS C:\>  Get-Module -Name PowerShellGet -ListAvailable
PS C:\>  Get-Module -Name PackageManagement -ListAvailable
