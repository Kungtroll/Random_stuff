Install Git (if not already installed)
Install Visual Studio Code (if not already installed)
Make a new folder to use as your repository root folder
Open a terminal prompt (i use the powershell integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code)
Type: git --version', this should return the git version you installed in step 1.
Type: git config --global user.name "My Name" (use your own name of course)
Type: git config --global user.email "my.email@scania.com" (use your own email of course)
Make your own repository:
Open to the folder you created in step 3. (cd C:\MyNewRepo) in Visual Studio Code
Click the Source Control tab in the left side pane in Visual Studio Code (or use Ctrl+Shift+G)
Click the + to initialize the repository in the folder you created (C:\MyNewRepo).
Now you have a local repository with version control.
or Clone an existing repository:
Open visual studio Code
Close any Open folders or workspaces
Press Ctrl+Shift+P
Type git clone and then enter (now visual studio code asks for the Repository URL)
Open your favourity webbrowser and enter the repository link (GitHub or Azure Devops / TFS.
Click Repos, select the repo you want to clone, (Azure devops example)
Click the clone button to get the repo link. 
Paste the link in the visual studio code prompt that now asks for Repository URL, then press enter.
Navigate to the folder you created as your repository root folder (C:\MyNewRepo).
Now you will have a clone of the repository and can push to the repository.
